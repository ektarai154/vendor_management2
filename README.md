# vendor_management2
Creating a vendor management system using Django Rest Framework (DRF) involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Set Up Django Project:

Install Django and Django Rest Framework:

pip install django djangorestframework
django-admin startproject vendor_management
cd vendor_management
Create a new Django app for your vendor management system:
python manage.py startapp vendors
Define Models:

In the vendors app, define models for vendors, products, and any other relevant entities. For example in code given
Run migrations to apply these changes to the database:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create Serializers:

Define serializers to convert your model instances to JSON and vice versa. This is especially important when working with APIs.

Create Views:

Use DRF's class-based views to define how data is presented to the user. This involves creating views for listing, creating, updating, and deleting vendors and products.

Configure URLs:

Set up URLs to map to your views. This involves creating a urls.py file in your vendors app.

Include these URLs in your project's main urls.py.

Run the Server:

Start the development server:

python manage.py runserver
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/vendors/ and http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/ to interact with your API.
Authentication and Permissions (Optional):

If needed, add authentication and permissions to your views to control access.
This is a basic setup, and you can extend it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, consider using Django Rest Framework's features like viewsets, routers, and permissions for a more robust and feature-rich API.
